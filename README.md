# Semaphore Project with Threads and Swing Interface in Java

This is a project that simulates a semaphore using threads and the Swing graphical interface in Java. The project aims to demonstrate the functioning of a semaphore with signal states (Green, Yellow, and Red) controlled through threads, providing an interactive visual experience.

## Features

- Simulation of a semaphore with Green, Yellow, and Red states.
- Use of threads to control transitions between states.
- User-friendly graphical interface developed with the Swing library.
- Real-time visual demonstration of semaphore states.

## Prerequisites

- Installed JDK (Java Development Kit).
- Java development environment (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.) optional.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Open the project in your Java development environment.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Observe the semaphore simulation and its state transitions in the graphical interface.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or send a pull request with improvements, bug fixes, or new features.
